\section{Use of Large Language Models}
In compliance with the \textit{Course Policy on the Use of Large Language Models (LLMs)}, LLMs were used exclusively for correcting the grammatical errors and improving the stylistic clarity, and not for generating ideas or drafting new text passages. The used prompts had the patterns: "Please provide feedback on the readability of the following paragraph: ..." and "Please fix the grammar in the following paragraph: ...".
